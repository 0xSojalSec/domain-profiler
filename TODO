Need better detection of webhost!
We should be able to tell the difference between EC2 hosts and normal amazon hosts
SSL detection should return :none if there isn't something listening on 443 or no cert was returned.
Determine if there is no SSL certificate or of there is a parsing error
Why does DNS detection return :none sometimes? WTF
Determine if there is a whois error, or if it's a parsing error


Decisions that cost money:
  - Registrar
  - Web host
  - DNS host
  - Mail host
  - SSL Issuer
  - SSL Certificate type

# made decision:
#  - [dns ] outsourced email?
#  - [dns ] spf?
#  - [dns ] ttl's on DNS?
#  - [dns ] dns duration
#  - [ssl ] ssl expires
#  - [ssl ] ssl duration
#  - [whoi] domain expires
#  - [as  ] different ASes
#  - [as  ] multi-homing dns?
#  - [as  ] all services in same as?
#  - [curl] valid xhtml?
#  - [curl] frontend type
#  - [nmap] port scan (is port 22 open?)
#  - [dns+] check for *.records
