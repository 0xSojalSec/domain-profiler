Determine if there is a whois error, or if it's a parsing error

SSL detection should have a 3-6 second timeout.

Rename all instances of domain-profile to domain-profiler

Decisions that cost money:
  - Registrar
  - Web host
  - DNS host
  - Mail host
  - SSL Issuer
  - SSL Certificate type

Decisions that don't necessarily cost money:
  - SPF records, and values thereof
  - TTL on DNS records
  - Expiration date for domain
  - Expiration date for ssl certificate
  - Is there more than one result for the A, MX, or NS records?
    - If so, are they in different Autonomous Systems?
  - Are all services (A, MX, NS) in the same AS?
  - Does the main webpage have valid XHTML?
  - What type of frontend?
  - What type of mailserver?
  - What type of DNS server?
  - Is there a * record in DNS?
